Persona 2: Innocent Sin (PSX)
Debug menu patch

by Revenant (d@revenant1.net)
for The Cutting Room Floor (tcrf.net)
-------------------------------------

This patch is designed to restore some debugging functionality which is present
in release versions of the game, but was made inaccessible. To use it, patch a
BIN/CUE copy of the game, then press Select+Start at almost any time to access
the menu.

Some of the features on this menu (the scene viewer and the dungeon warp) no
longer work correctly, but there's still plenty of other interesting things to
see, as well.

This is based on the corresponding patch for Eternal Punishment, which was in
turn based on the leaked prerelease version which had that debug menu (and much
more) enabled by default. There are some slight differences between the menus
in both games but the actual accessible content is more or less the same.
