Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (PSX)
Debug menu patch

by Revenant (d@revenant1.net)
for The Cutting Room Floor (tcrf.net)
-------------------------------------

This patch is designed to restore some debugging functionality which is present
in release versions of the game, but was made inaccessible. To use it, patch a
BIN/CUE copy of the game, then press Select+Start at almost any time to access
the menu.

In addition, "Debug" is added to all shop and Velvet Room menus and will bring
up another, smaller debug menu.

The leaked US prerelease version of the game has this menu and many other debug
features available by default; this patch was an attempt to access what was
left on the final disc, but does not restore anything that was removed from the
game entirely.

Two of the features on this menu (the scene viewer and the dungeon warp) no
longer work correctly, but there's still plenty of other interesting things to
see, as well. If you really want those two features to work too, just track
down a copy of the US prerelease/beta version, which doesn't require any codes
or patches.

Another debug patch for Innocent Sin should be done soon, so stay tuned...
